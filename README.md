# Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

I need to modify a starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Back-end needs to be built and connect and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.


## User Story
